# Overview

I developed a Recipe Organizer in Kotlin using IntelliJ with the primary goal of creating a practical application for managing and organizing recipes. The Recipe Organizer allows users to add, edit, and delete recipes, as well as search for specific recipes based on the categories they get to create.

In this project, the focus was on leveraging Kotlin for backend functionality. The application is designed to be intuitive, for users to input and manage their favourite recipes.

My purpose for developing this software was to enhance my skills in Kotlin programming and gain experience in creating desktop applications using IntelliJ IDEA. This project allowed me to explore various aspects of software development, including user interface design, data management, and application functionality.
